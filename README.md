## Project Overview
This project was designed to showcase a fundamental understanding of HTML and CSS. As my first foray into web development, I focused on applying core concepts such as WCAG best practices, flexboxes, grids, and media queries. The goal was to create a website that reflected my initial grasp of these essential web design principles.

## Process
In this project, I worked with basic HTML and CSS to construct a functional website layout. A significant part of the process involved learning and implementing flexboxes and grids to effectively organize content. I also used media queries to ensure the site was responsive across various devices. Following WCAG best practices, I aimed to create a website that was accessible to all users. This project provided a hands-on introduction to fundamental web development techniques and tools.

## Challenges and Solutions
As this was my first website, I encountered several challenges, particularly with resizing images and fixing layout issues in HTML. Many of these problems arose from my initial inexperience with proper coding practices and responsive design techniques. Through trial and error, I learned to use flexboxes and grids more effectively, which helped me overcome these layout challenges. Gradually, I improved the siteâ€™s structure and functionality, refining my understanding of HTML and CSS along the way.

## Lessons Learned
This project underscored the importance of mastering fundamental web design principles, particularly the use of grids and flexboxes for layout. I also gained valuable insights into responsive design through media queries. The challenges I faced highlighted the steep learning curve in web development and emphasized the need for continuous improvement in my coding skills.

## Conclusion
Despite its rough initial implementation, this project served as a crucial learning experience in my web development journey. It allowed me to practice and apply basic HTML and CSS concepts, including grids and flexboxes, setting the foundation for more advanced projects. The lessons learned from this project have been instrumental in my growth as a developer and in enhancing my approach to web design.
